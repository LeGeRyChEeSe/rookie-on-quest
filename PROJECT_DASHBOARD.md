## 🚧 Work In Progress (Priorities)

These features are currently on the workbench. They aim to make the application more autonomous and robust.

### 🔴 Priority 1: Critical Infrastructure
*   **Shizuku Integration**: Enable game installation without having to click "Confirm" every time. This will make the experience close to an official store.
*   **WorkManager (Background Tasks)**: Replace the current system so downloads continue reliably even if the app is minimized or if the system tries to stop it to save battery.

### 🟠 Priority 2: User Experience
*   **Title Cleaning**: An intelligent system to remove technical tags (e.g., `[v123]`, `(Multi)`) from game names for a cleaner list.
*   **Foreground Service**: A persistent notification to better manage and visualize ongoing downloads outside the app.

## 🏗️ Simplified Architecture

How does the app work under the hood?

## 🔮 The Future (Backlog)

Planned for later, once technical foundations (Shizuku/WorkManager) are complete.

*   **Immersive Grid Mode**: A grid view with large game posters, optimized for viewing through VR headset lenses.
*   **Backups**: Backup and restore game data (`/Android/data`).
*   **External Sources**: Ability to add your own game sources (JSON files).
